# Pic Some React App

## Project Description - E-commerce site

This React App demonstrates some of the key functionality used in Modern React
and JavaScript.  Pic Some is the design of an E-commerce site that mocks up
how React can be used for a Single Page Application (SPA).

The layout is designed for a photo print store, and allows users to add pictures 
to their cart for later review and purchase.

The useState hook is used to track picture favorites and cart status. Clicking the 
cart icon will take the user to the purchase screen where items can also be removed 
from the cart.
